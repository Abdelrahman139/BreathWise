# Graduation Project

This repository contains the unified codebase for the graduation project, including the Frontend application and Machine Learning components.

## Directory Structure

- `frontend/`: The React-based frontend application.
- `ml/`: Machine Learning notebooks and data.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for model training and preprocessing.
  - `data/`: Dataset headers and images.
- `backend/`: Backend application (Currently pending setup).

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *Note: Node.js version 20.0.0 or higher is recommended.*
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Machine Learning

1.  Navigate to the `ml` directory.
2.  Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed.
3.  Install required libraries (pandas, numpy, tensorflow/pytorch, matplotlib, etc.).
4.  Open the notebooks in `ml/notebooks/` to view or run the analysis.

## Backend

*The backend code is currently unavailable due to a corrupted archive. Please provide a valid `backend.zip` to proceed with setup.*
